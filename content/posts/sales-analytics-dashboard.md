# Search API Performance Optimization

A performance optimization project that transformed a slow search API into a high-performance system through strategic caching implementation.

## Overview

This project focused on dramatically improving the performance of a search API system at ETS International, reducing response times from 1400ms to 380ms through Redis caching implementation.

## Key Achievements

- **73% Performance Improvement**: Reduced API response time from 1400ms to 380ms
- **Database Query Optimization**: Reduced queries from 9+ to 1 per request
- **Redis Caching System**: Implemented strategic caching for frequently accessed data
- **Real-time KPI Dashboards**: Created interactive dashboards for monitoring performance

## Technical Implementation

### Caching Strategy
- Redis implementation for frequently queried search results
- Strategic cache invalidation policies
- Memory optimization for efficient cache utilization
- Cache warming strategies for improved user experience

### Database Architecture
- Designed optimized database schema for KPI monitoring
- Implemented efficient query patterns
- Created data synchronization between PostgreSQL and Redis
- QA and error handling mechanisms

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time KPI dashboards for business operations
- Comprehensive metrics tracking for optimization opportunities
- User metadata tracking for experience improvements
- API stress testing implementation

## Tools & Technologies

- **Caching**: Redis for high-performance data caching
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
- **Testing**: Apache Benchmark and wrk for stress testing
- **Monitoring**: Custom KPI dashboards for real-time insights
- **Integration**: Third-party partner endpoints

## Results

- **73% faster API responses** (1400ms â†’ 380ms)
- **90% reduction** in database queries per request
- **Improved user experience** through faster search results
- **Enhanced system scalability** through efficient caching
