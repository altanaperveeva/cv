# Search V2 API Performance Optimization

Led the complete performance optimization of a critical Search V2 API, achieving a **73% improvement in response time** from 1400ms to ~380ms through strategic Redis caching implementation and database query optimization.

## The Challenge

The existing search API was experiencing severe performance bottlenecks:
- **1400ms average response time** impacting user experience
- **8+ sequential database queries** per request creating cascading delays
- Manual cache synchronization leading to inconsistent performance
- High database load affecting overall system stability

## Technical Solution

### Redis Caching Architecture
Designed and implemented a comprehensive Redis caching layer that eliminated the majority of database calls:

- **Organizations Cache**: Structured by type (airport/airline) for O(1) lookups
- **Terminals Cache**: Direct key-based access using airport ID and terminal code
- **MCT Matrix Cache**: Optimized connection time validation data
- **Pipeline Operations**: Batch Redis queries for parallel data retrieval

### Real-time Cache Management
Built an automated cache invalidation system integrated across multiple API endpoints:

- **Automatic Updates**: Cache refreshes triggered by data modifications
- **Smart TTL Management**: 1-hour TTL with real-time extensions
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Seamless degradation when cache misses occur
- **Batch Sync Endpoint**: Manual bulk cache population for maintenance

### Database Query Optimization
Strategically reduced database dependencies while maintaining data integrity:

- **Query Elimination**: Removed 7 out of 8 database calls per request
- **Strategic Preservation**: Kept essential business logic queries
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: Replaced sequential queries with parallel Redis operations

## Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
- **Redis** with ioredis client for high-performance caching
- **TypeScript/Node.js** for type-safe backend development
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage
- **Next.js** API routes for endpoint implementation

### Architecture Components
```typescript
// Core cache utilities with pipeline operations
const pipeline = redisClient.pipeline();
codes.forEach(code => pipeline.hgetall(`airports:iata:${code}`));
const results = await pipeline.exec(); // 10ms vs 600ms sequential

// Real-time cache updates
await updateOrganizationCacheOnCreate(organization);
await updateTerminalCacheOnUpsert(terminal);
```

### Integration Points
- **Frontend Components**: Terminal management UI with automatic cache updates
- **API Endpoints**: Contract creation, organization updates, operational management
- **Background Services**: Automated sync and monitoring systems

## Results & Impact

### Performance Improvements
- **Response Time**: 1400ms â†’ 380ms (**73% reduction**)
- **Database Load**: 90% reduction in query volume
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >95% for production workloads
- **Load Testing**: Validated performance under stress with k6, maintaining sub-500ms response times at scale
- **User Experience**: Sub-second API responses

### Business Value
- Improved application responsiveness for end users
- Reduced infrastructure costs through lower database utilization
- Enhanced system scalability and reliability
- Foundation for future performance optimizations
